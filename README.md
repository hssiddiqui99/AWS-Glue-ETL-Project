# AWS-Glue-ETL-Project

This repository showcases a comprehensive hands-on AWS Glue project, where I implemented various AWS Glue functionalities in a simulated production environment. Through this project, I gained practical experience with key AWS services involved in data integration, preparation, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Below, I describe my approach, setup, and the challenges I addressed to demonstrate my knowledge of the AWS Glue ecosystem.

Project Scope and Objectives
This project was based on a course that covered AWS Glue's updated features. My objective was to utilize these services effectively to catalog, transform, and analyze data stored in Amazon S3. This project covers:

AWS Glue Data Catalog: Creating and managing metadata.
AWS Glue Databases and Tables: Structuring data definitions.
AWS Glue Crawlers: Automatically populating the Data Catalog.
AWS Glue ETL Jobs: Transforming raw data for analysis.
AWS Glue Data Quality and DataBrew: Enhancing and validating data.
AWS Glue Triggers and Workflows: Orchestrating ETL processes.
Data and Schema
The project involved working with two datasets: Customers and Orders. Below are sample records from each:

Customers

CustomerID	FirstName	LastName	FullName
293	Catherine	Abel	Catherine Abel
295	Kim	Abercrombie	Kim Abercrombie
Orders

SalesOrderID	OrderDate	CustomerID	TotalDue	ProductID	OrderQty
71782	5/1/2014	293	37497.45	714	3
These datasets were uploaded to Amazon S3 in the rawData folder, with the folder structure organized by entity (e.g., customers and orders).

Setup and Configuration
The project setup involved deploying resources using Amazon CloudFormation and structuring data in S3. Key setup steps included:

Creating S3 Buckets and Folders: The S3 bucket contained folders for raw data, processed data, scripts, temporary files, and Athena queries.

    │       └── orders.csv 
    ├── scriptLocation    
    └── tmpDir
IAM Roles: Created IAM roles with permissions for AWS Glue, S3, and Athena.

Data Upload: Uploaded the source data files (e.g., customers.csv, orders.csv) into the designated S3 folders.

AWS Glue Services and Concepts Used
AWS Glue Data Catalog
Used AWS Glue Data Catalog to store and manage metadata for the datasets, enabling data discovery and organizing schema information for the ETL process.

AWS Glue Databases and Tables
Created databases and tables to logically group datasets, allowing me to structure data definitions and organize data in a way suitable for analysis and transformation.

AWS Glue Crawlers
Set up crawlers to automate the process of discovering datasets, creating table metadata, and updating the Data Catalog. This was crucial for ensuring the schema stayed synchronized with source data.

AWS Glue ETL
Implemented ETL jobs using AWS Glue Studio to transform and enrich data. These jobs extracted data from S3, applied transformations, and loaded the processed data into designated S3 folders. This hands-on experience allowed me to practice writing PySpark scripts and using Glue’s automatic code generation features.

AWS Glue Data Quality
Used AWS Glue DataBrew to cleanse and validate data, identifying and handling data quality issues through DataBrew transformations. This was key in ensuring the reliability of the data used in further analysis.

AWS Glue Triggers and Workflows
Orchestrated ETL jobs with AWS Glue triggers and workflows to automate and monitor the pipeline, setting up event-based and scheduled triggers for seamless data processing.

Supported Data Connections
AWS Glue offers connections to multiple data sources. For this project, I explored connection setups for:

Amazon S3: Primary storage location for source and target datasets.
Amazon Athena: Used for querying processed data.
Lessons Learned
Completing this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of AWS Glue’s ecosystem and its seamless integration with other AWS services, such as S3 and Athena. I also gained insights into:

The importance of data cataloging and metadata management in large-scale data environments.
Optimizing ETL jobs for efficient resource utilization.
Designing workflows to maintain data quality and support scalable data processing.
Future Improvements
In a real-world scenario, additional steps could be taken, such as:

Implementing advanced partitioning for optimizing data storage and retrieval.
Leveraging Glue’s integration with AWS Lambda for further customizations.
Conclusion
This project served as a comprehensive hands-on experience with AWS Glue and its related services. It reinforced my understanding of data integration, ETL operations, and workflow automation in a serverless AWS environment, preparing me for further AWS Glue projects and broader data engineering tasks.
